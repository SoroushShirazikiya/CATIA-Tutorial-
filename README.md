# Design of a Mechanical Bracket from draft in catia | Step-by-Step Tutorial
I uploaded a detailed tutorial on Design of a Mechanical Bracket from Draft in CATIA. In this video, I guide you step-by-step through the design process, explaining key CAD techniques in English.

This tutorial is part of my growing portfolio that showcases both my technical skills and English communication ability â€” important as I pursue a fully funded PhD scholarship in mechanical engineering.
